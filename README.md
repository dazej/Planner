# Planner
This is my comprehensive website for the Type A individuals that always
feel like any online planner is not detailed enough or user-friendly enough for what they are trying to acheive. 
Built for people with short-term goals, long-term goals, or even just a busy agenda. This interactive planner integrates what people love about the physical planners and online planners. Making sure that it provides seamless time management for the user.

Any suggestions or comments are greatly appreciated because I want to make this planner as usable as possible for anybody.

Think of this website as Notion and Google Calendar had a baby, and this website is the baby...
